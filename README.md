# Transactions-of-taxis-in-NYC

Objective:
For a New York City taxi driver, being in the right place at the right time is often what makes or breaks a day. To assist drivers in this decision, I explored with random forest classifier to figure out which would be the best input feature to predict total amount given many input features.

DATASET:
Dataset was obtained from [Click Here](https://data.world/datasets/nyc-taxi). The dataset size is 566MB. The dataset has 17 columns.  

Workflow:
1. Download and install streamlit
2. Decide on design
3. Bring in the data
4. Collect user input
5. Model training
6. Interpreting the results of our classifier
7. Optimize the app's runtime
8. Personalize the app

Future Scope:
1. The app is only restricted to finding the best input parametr to predict our target variable. we can extend the idea to make actual predictions
2. Deploy the app
